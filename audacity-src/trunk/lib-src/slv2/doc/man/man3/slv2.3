.SH NAME
SLV2 \- SLV2 is a host library to simplify the discovery, loading, and use of LV2 plugins (http://lv2plug.in).  

.PP
SLV2 is written in standard C99, and depends only on the Redland RDF library (http://librdf.org). It should be portable to any system with Redland, and is tested on various GNU/Linux distributions (often), and MacOS X (occasionally).
.PP
The Data (RDF) and code (shared library) functionality in SLV2 is strictly separated so it is simple to control where each is used (e.g. it is possible to discover/investigate plugins and related data without loading any shared libraries, avoiding the associated risks).
