                       Redland RDF Application Framework

[2]Dave Beckett

Overview

   [3]Redland is a library that provides a high-level interface for the
   Resource Description Framework (RDF) allowing the RDF graph to be
   parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland implements
   each of the RDF concepts in its own class via an object based API,
   reflected into the language APIs, currently C#, Java, Perl, PHP,
   Python, Ruby and Tcl. Several classes providing functionality such as
   for parsers, storage are built as modules that can be loaded at compile
   or run-time as required.

   This is a mature and stable RDF library developed since 2000 used in
   multiple projects. See the [4]FAQS for general information and the
   [5]Redland issue tracker for known bugs and issues. A summary of the
   changes can be found in the [6]NEWS file, detailed API changes in the
   [7]release notes and file-by-file changes in the Subversion
   [8]ChangeLog.

   Redland provides:
     * A modular, [9]object based library written in C
     * APIs for manipulating the RDF [10]graph and parts - [11]Statements,
       [12]Resources and Literals
     * Language Bindings in C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl via
       the [13]Redland Bindings package.
     * Support for multiple syntaxes for reading and writing RDF with
       [14]Parsers and [15]Serializers for [16]RDF/XML, [17]N-Triples and
       [18]Turtle Terse RDF Triple Language syntax via the [19]Raptor RDF
       Parser Toolkit.
     * [20]Storage for graphs in memory and persistently with
       Sleepycat/Berkeley DB, MySQL 3-5, PostgreSQL, [21]AKT Triplestore
       library, [22]SQLite, files or URIs.
     * [23]Query language support for RDQL using [24]Rasqal.
     * APIs for accessing the graph by Statement (triples) or by Nodes and
       Arcs
     * Redland contexts for managing aggregating graphs and recording
       provenance.
     * [25]Statement Streams for efficient construction, parsing and
       serialisation of graphs
     * [26]rdfproc RDF processor utility program
     * No memory leaks.
