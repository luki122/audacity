These simple examples show the different ways that an application may
interface with libsoxr.  Note that real-world applications may also have to
deal with file-formats, codecs, (more sophisticated) dithering, etc., which
are not covered here.

With libsoxr installed, the examples may be built using commands similar to
the following.  On unix-like systems:

    cc 1-single-block.c -lsoxr

or, on MS-Windows:

    cl 1-single-block.c -I"C:/Program Files/soxr/include" "C:/Program Files/soxr/lib/soxr.lib"

IDEs may hide such commands behind configuration screens and build menus --
where applicable, consult your IDE's user-manual.
