SoX Resampler Library       Copyright (c) 2007-12 robs@users.sourceforge.net

1. Prerequisites:

    Before you can build this library, you need to have available on your
    system:

    * A C-compiler with 64-bit integer support and, optionally, OpenMP, SIMD.

    * A 'make' utility (most compiler installations already have one of these).

    * CMake: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html


2. Build:

    At a command prompt, change directory (`cd') to the one containing this
    file, then enter:

        go                          (on MS-Windows with nmake)
    or
        ./go                        (on unix-like systems)

    This should build the library and run a few sanity tests.


3. Installation:

    Note that this step may need to be performed by a system
    adminstrator.  Enter:

        nmake install               (on MS-Windows)
    or
        cd Release; make install    (on unix)


4. Configuration:

    To use the library you may need to set up appropriate paths to the
    library and its header file in your development environment.


5. Installation test

    To test the installation, build and run the first example programme (see
    examples/README).


If it is necessary to customise the build, then steps 2 and 3 above may be
substituted as follows.  Change directory to the one containing this file,
then enter commands along the lines of:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake [OPTIONS] ..
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

To list help on the available options, enter:

    cmake -LH ..

Options, if given, should be preceded with '-D', e.g.

    cmake -DWITH_SIMD:BOOL=OFF ..
