No library needs to be built for iAVC.

The file src/effects/AvcCompressor.cpp includes the iAVC files.
While it is somewhat unorthodox to include a .cpp file, it
does save building a library.

Keeping the iAVC files in a directory of its own is appropriate
and makes it easy to remember that iAVC is under LGPL license
and not simply part of Audacity.
