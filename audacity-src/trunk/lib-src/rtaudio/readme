Modified for Audacity distribution by Dominic Mazzoni, 2006.  The
configure/make system builds librtaudio.a and rtaudio-config, and
ASIO has been removed for licensing reasons.

OVERVIEW:

RtAudio is a set of C++ classes which provide a common API (Application Programming Interface) for realtime audio input/output across Linux (native ALSA, JACK, and OSS), SGI, Macintosh OS X (CoreAudio), and Windows (DirectSound and ASIO) operating systems. RtAudio significantly simplifies the process of interacting with computer audio hardware. It was designed with the following goals:

  - object oriented C++ design
  - simple, common API across all supported platforms
  - only two header files and one source file for easy inclusion in programming projects
  - allow simultaneous multi-api support
  - blocking functionality
  - callback functionality
  - extensive audio device parameter control
  - audio device capability probing
  - automatic internal conversion for data format, channel number compensation, de-interleaving, and byte-swapping

RtAudio incorporates the concept of audio streams, which represent audio output (playback) and/or input (recording). Available audio devices and their capabilities can be enumerated and then specified when opening a stream.  Where applicable, multiple API support can be compiled and a particular API specified when creating an RtAudio instance.

The RtAudio API provides both blocking (synchronous) and callback (asyncronous) functionality. Callbacks are typically used in conjunction with graphical user interfaces (GUI). Blocking functionality is often necessary for explicit control of multiple input/output stream synchronization or when audio must be synchronized with other system events.
