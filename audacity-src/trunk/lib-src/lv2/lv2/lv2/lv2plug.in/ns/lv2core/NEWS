    can be assigned to ports for more intelligent use by hosts.
  * Relax the range of lv2:index so it can be used for things other than ports.
  * Remove lv2:Resource, which turned out to be meaningless.
  * Add new discovery API which allows libraries to read bundle files during
    discovery, makes library construction/destruction explicit, and adds
    extensibility to prevent future breakage.
  * Fix LV2_SYMBOL_EXPORT and lv2_descriptor prototype for Windows.
  * Add lv2:CVPort.
  * Merge with unified LV2 package.

    conventions.

    support some URI for extension_data().
