This is intended as a list of all the patches that have been incorporated into
the lib-src copies of libraries, to avoid them getting lost in version upgrades
from upstream, and to remind us of the versions we are using.

Libraries
=========
dlcompat
--------
Support library for dynamic loading of modules on OS X 10.3 and older. Used
for LADSPA on OS X support, and probably not any where else

expat
-----
XML parser library used to parse project files and so on. By default the
system copy is prefered over this one, even on OS X (where it is shipped by
default). Build against system 2.0.1 works fine.
Version in Audacity SVN: 1.2
Patches: None
Upstream version: 2.0.1

FileDialogue
------------
The customised file saving dialogues for wxwidgets to provide the options
button for format preferences. This is written and maintained by us so doesn't
have an upstream at the moment.

iAVC

id3lib
------

libid3tag
---------
MP3 tag manipulation library. Comes with libmad (below)
arguments ([-Wall foreign]) added to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE to avoid autoreconf

purposes.
Version in Audacity SVN: 0.1.7
Patches: endian.m4, lrint.m4, llrint.m4, lrintf.m4, clip_mode.m4 copied from

liblrdf
-------
Patches:
AM_MAINTAINER_MODE has been added to configure.ac to disable autotools rebuilds
by default


lib-widget-extra
----------------

mod-script-pipe
---------------

portaudio
---------
http://portaudio.com/
cross-platform audio I/O library version 18, used for 1.2.x version of
Audacity.
Quite heavily patched local copy to get AC-97 ALSA cards to play back
correctly.

portaudio-v19
-------------
http://portaudio.com/
cross-platform audio I/O library version 19, used for 1.3.2 onwards releases
Version in Audacity SVN: 1st July 2009 SVN snapshot (r1416)
Patches:
../portmixer/portaudio.patch	add features needed to make portmixer work.
		Integration by upstream in progress. Will need updating as upstream
		portaudio moves

portaudio/libtool22.patch	Patch from Gentoo to ensure that static libraries
are always built, not shared ones, otherwise the assumptions elsewhere in the
build system break. Not suitable for upstream, what is needed is more
powerfull autoconf features to pass the right options to portaudio's configure
script, which suffers from the broken-ness of autoconf's subdirectory support

portsmf
-------
http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/
Cross-platform Midi file reader and writer (succeeded and obsoltes allegro)
Version in Audacity SVN: SVN snapshot from ????
Patches:
portsmf-includes.patch	add include of <cstring> needed to compile with recent
						GCC versions
portsmf-string-const.patch	Add string const qualifiers as needed
local-macros.patch		Add all the necessary 3rd party m4 macros into autotools
						/m4/ and supporting changes.
unsigned-const-casts.patch	Build fix for Solaris compiler, adds casts to
						unsigned integer literals.
AM_MAINTAINER_MODE has been added to configure.ac to disable autotools rebuilds
by default
All patches have been added to upstream patch tracker at
https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?group_id=196750&atid=958711


portburn
--------
Doesn't do anything yet

portmixer
---------
cross-platform audio mixer control library, hooked onto portaudio. Maintained
by the Audacity project with some help from portaudio development.

redland
-------
http://librdf.org
RDF parser and query engine. Consists of three separate libraries, Raptor
(the parser), Rasqal (the query engine) and librdf (triple storage and
wrapper API). It is needed for liblrdf and SLV2.
Version in Audacity SVN: 1.0.8
Patches:
audacity_build_tweaks.patch	Patches the configure scripts to turn off parsers, storage models and query languages not used by Audacity as well as using Expat instead of libxml2 for XML parsing. No need to integrate with upstream.

rtaudio
-------
http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/
Another cross-platform audio I/O library that was at one point available as an
alternative to portaudio.

sbsms
-----
http://sbsms.sourceforge.net/
An audio stretching library for changing pitch or tempo without changing the
other. Alternative to SoundTouch, better on large changes but slower.
Version in Audacity SVN: ??
Patches:
Misc fixes to configure.in/Makefile.am for autoconf macros and libtool. More
files added to m4/ directory by libtoolizing commited to Audacity SVN.
AM_MAINTAINER_MODE has been added to configure.ac to disable autotools rebuilds
by default
dont-mangle-cflags.patch	patch to stop sed-ing the CXXFLAGS and achieve the
same ends by better means, replacing a hacked version from Gentoo. Patch
linked to from upstream tracker at
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2561247&group_id=177794&atid=882654
because attachements there don't seem to work.

slv2
-------
http://wiki.drobilla.net/SLV2
Support library for LV2 hosts (like Audacity).
Version in Audacity SVN: 0.6.0
Patches:
audacity_build_tweaks.patch	Patches the configure scripts to not build hosts and utility programs and to use local Redland libraries if requested. No need to integrate with upstream.
lv2core_internal.patch		Add lv2.h as an internal header to avoid the dependency on lv2core.
i18n.patch					Patch to support translation of some form?
AM_MAINTAINER_MODE has been added to configure.ac to disable autotools rebuilds
by default

soundtouch
----------
http://www.surina.net/soundtouch/
Independant Pitch and Tempo changing library.
Version in Audacity SVN: 1.3.1
Patches:
PPC mac build changes to configure.in in several places
correct-const-usage.patch: makes usage of const keyword consistent so it
compiles with Sun's C++ compiler. Patch sent upstream 17/03/2008
fix-includes.patch: needed for GCC 4.3.1 to include all the headers we use
directly. In upstream SVN
Argument ([-Wall foreign]) added to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE because autoreconf fails
otherwise

If replacing via svn, you need to do the following to generate the configure
scripts (from within the base taglib directory):
   sh admin/cvs.sh dist

And remove the .svn directories (from within the base taglib direcotry):
   find -d . -path \*/.svn\* -exec rm -rf \{\} \;

Crib notes on upgrading lib-src trees:
======================================
1 Remove old files
------------------
find . -not -wholename '*CVS*' -delete
will remove all the source files but not any directories or the CVS files, so
after this you have an empty place into which you can unpack the new tarball

2 Bring in new files
--------------------
Next unpack the tarball. If you want to unpack within a package directory,
then tar --strip-components 1 will remove the un-needed top level directory.

3 Apply patches and updates
---------------------------
Now we have a new file tree. This is the point at which to clean out any
un-needed files, re-apply any local patches so on. To clean up after patching,
run  find . -name '*.orig' -delete and  find . -name '*~' -delete. To remove
.svn directories from projects that use SVN upstream, use
find . -wholename '*/.svn/*' -delete and then find . -name '.svn' -delete

* run autoreconf if we have modified configure.in or configure.ac
* If the package uses libtool, run libtoolize --copy --force to update 
	ltmain.sh, config.sub, config.guess. If not, update config.sub,
	config.guess from /usr/share/gnuconfig/

By doing it this way we have already updated the mtime on all files, so we
don't need to do a recusive touch.

4 Add new files to CVS and remove old ones
------------------------------------------
CVS will list files with a ? if they are new and need to be added to the
repository. To get a list, run 
cvs st 2>/dev/null | grep '?'
Remember to ignore the generated files from the build system which don't need
to be included in CVS, like aclocal.m4 and autom4te.cache

Finding which files have been removed is a bit harder:
cvs st 2>/dev/null | grep 'Status: Needs Checkout'
gives file names but not their paths, so you have to go back and grep each
file name to find them and do cvs rm on them.

To remove all the files that are in the working directory but aren't under CVS
control, you can use this incantation:
\rm $(cvs st 2>/dev/null | grep '?' | cut -d '?' -f 2)

5 Commit the lot to CVS
-----------------------
Run cvs ci -f -R to commit all the files in the new library tree. Use an
appropriate message that says what library version this is. This should do
all the required changes and add / remove files.
