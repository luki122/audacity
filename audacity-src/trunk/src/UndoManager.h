  UndoManager.h

  After each operation, call UndoManager's PushState, pass it
  the entire track hierarchy.  The UndoManager makes a duplicate
  of every single track using its Duplicate method, which should
  increment reference counts.  If we were not at the top of
  the stack when this is called, delete above first.

  If a minor change is made, for example changing the visual
  display of a track or changing the selection, you can call
  ModifyState, which replaces the current state with the 
  one you give it, without deleting everything above it.

  Each action has a long description and a short description
  associated with it.  The long description appears in the
  History window and should be a complete sentence in the
  past tense, for example, "Deleted 2 seconds.".  The short
  description should be one or two words at most, all
  capitalized, and should represent the name of the command.
  It will be appended on the end of the word "Undo" or "Redo",
  for example the short description of "Deleted 2 seconds."
  would just be "Delete", resulting in menu titles
  "Undo Delete" and "Redo Delete".

  UndoManager can also automatically consolidate actions into
  a single state change.  If the "consolidate" argument to
  PushState is true, then up to 3 identical events in a row
  will result in one PushState and 2 ModifyStates.

  Undo() temporarily moves down one state and returns the track
  hierarchy.  If another PushState is called, the redo information
  is lost.
