  Audacity: A Digital Audio Editor

  Experimental.h

  Used for #includes and #defines for experimental features.

  When the features become mainstream the #include files will 
  move out of here and into the files which need them.  The
  #defines will then be retired.



  JKC: This file solves a problem of how to avoid forking the
  code base when working on new features e.g:
    - Additional displays in Audacity
    - Modular architecture.
  Add #defines in here for the new features, and make your code
  conditional on those #defines.
  
  All the #defines are positive, i.e., when defined, 
  they enable the feature.

// and displaying those categories as submenus in the Effect menu.
// This was a 2008 GSoC project that was making good progress at the half-way point
// but then the student didn't contribute after that.  It needs a bit of work to finish it off.
// As a minimum, if this is turned on for a release,
// it should have an easy mechanism to disable it at run-time, such as a menu item or a pref,
// preferrably disabled until other work is done.  Martyn 22/12/2008.

   // 3. The Audacity Tester is an extended version of the benchmarks
   // display.  The crucial idea is to be able to compare waveforms
   // where effects have been applied by audacity but using different 
   // block-sizes.  This should give high confidence that we don't
   // suffer from end-effects on buffers, e.g. losing one sample on
   // each buffer.
